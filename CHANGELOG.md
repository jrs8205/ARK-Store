# Changelog

## 1.2.0

- Published apps are read from a store index, one file rebuilt every hour, so the store loads
  at once and stays clear of GitHub's request limit however many apps it holds
- Direct lookups remain for sources added by hand and as a fallback

## 1.1.0

- Developers publish an app to the store by adding the topic `arkstore` to its repository;
  such apps appear for every user without anyone adding a source
- Sources remain for adding an account or a single repository by hand
- Release lookups are spaced out as the store grows, to stay within GitHub's request limit
